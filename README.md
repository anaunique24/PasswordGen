# PasswordGen

## Description
- In this project I wrote my JavaScript from scratch to create a random password generator.
- On this webpage, you will see a generate password button. When that button is pressed it will prompt you with questions to help specify what kind of password attributes you'd like to have.

## Usage
To use this webpage:
- Your first step is to click the "Generate Password" button
- You will be prompted with 5 questions asking what kind of character types you would like in your password
- Once you have cycled through each prompt, your password will appear in the text box in the middle of the screen
